- Please include comments when writing the code.
- Please write the variable name so that the meaning is clear.
- Please include the error handling.
- Put readability and maintenance first.

## Description
- Please add an explanation to the complex logic.

- If you can, answer in Korean.

# Core Directive
For EVERY task request, you MUST follow the three-phase process below in exact order. Each phase must be completed with expert-level precision and detail.

## Guiding Principles
- **Minimalistic Approach**: Implement high-quality, clean solutions while avoiding unnecessary complexity
- **Expert-Level Standards**: Every output must meet professional software engineering standards
- **Concrete Results**: Provide specific, actionable details at each step

---

## Phase 1: Codebase Exploration & Analysis
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. **Systematic File Discovery**
   - List ALL potentially relevant files, directories, and modules
   - Search for related keywords, functions, classes, and patterns
   - Examine each identified file thoroughly

2. **Convention & Style Analysis**
   - Document coding conventions (naming, formatting, architecture patterns)
   - Identify existing code style guidelines
   - Note framework/library usage patterns
   - Catalog error handling approaches

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
### Codebase Analysis Results
**Relevant Files Found:**
- [file_path]: [brief description of relevance]

**Code Conventions Identified:**
- Naming: [convention details]
- Architecture: [pattern details]
- Styling: [format details]

**Key Dependencies & Patterns:**
- [library/framework]: [usage pattern]
```

---

## Phase 2: Implementation Planning
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
Based on Phase 1 findings, create a detailed implementation roadmap.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Module: [Module Name]
**Summary:** [1-2 sentence description of what needs to be implemented]

**Tasks:**
- [ ] [Specific implementation task]
- [ ] [Specific implementation task]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion]
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion]
- [ ] [Performance/quality requirement]

### Module: [Next Module Name]
[Repeat structure above]
```

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Execution
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. Implement each module following the plan from Phase 2
2. Verify ALL acceptance criteria are met before proceeding
3. Ensure code adheres to conventions identified in Phase 1

**QUALITY GATES:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Code follows established conventions
- [ ] Minimalistic approach maintained
- [ ] Expert-level implementation standards met

---

## Success Validation
Before completing any task, confirm:
- ✅ All three phases completed sequentially
- ✅ Each phase output meets specified format requirements
- ✅ Implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria
- ✅ Code quality meets professional standards

## Response Structure
Always structure your response as:
1. **Phase 1 Results**: [Codebase analysis findings]
2. **Phase 2 Plan**: [Implementation roadmap]
3. **Phase 3 Implementation**: [Actual code with validation]

# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
  gemini command:

### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

Multiple files:
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

Entire directory:
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

Multiple directories:
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

Current directory and subdirectories:
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

Implementation Verification Examples

Check if a feature is implemented:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

Verify authentication implementation:
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

Check for specific patterns:
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

Verify error handling:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

Check for rate limiting:
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

Verify caching strategy:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

Check for specific security measures:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

Verify test coverage for features:
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

When to Use Gemini CLI

Use gemini -p when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
